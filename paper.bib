abstract = {Minnesota waterfowl management plans prescribe widespread deployment of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) nest structures. We compared 53 single- and 57 double-cylinder nest structures from 1996 to 2003 because managers used both structure types but were uncertain about their respective cost-effectiveness. More nests occurred in double-cylinder structures, but numbers of successful nests and hatched ducklings were comparable for both types. Nest success in single- and double-cylinder structures was 92.8{\%} and 79.4{\%}, respectively, with nest abandonment being {\textgreater}4.5 times greater in doubles. Structure damage occurred only at ice-out and was greater for doubles. However, relative risk of failure for double- versus single-cylinder structures was similar (1.26; 95{\%} CI = 0.91-1.75) and increased with size of the open-water area containing the structure. Modeling indicated approximately 95{\%} of recruits from nest structures were additional recruits. A case-history approach indicated doubles produced an additional recruit for {\$}23.11 versus {\$}23.25 for singles. However, these estimates were sensitive to assumptions used to apportion costs between structure types and ignored structure-placement influences. Placement affected cost-effectiveness significantly, with structures placed in open-water areas {\textgreater}10 ha being more cost-effective. Results also suggested singles might be more effective than doubles when placement is considered. Lower nest abandonment alone might make single-cylinder structures the better choice.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2015 American Statistical Association.The use of simulation-based methods for introducing inferen-ce is growing in popularity for the Stat 101 course, due in part to increasing evidence of the methods ability to improve studen-ts' statistical thinking. This impact comes from simulation-based methods (a) clearly presenting the overarching logic of inference, (b) strengthening ties between statistics and probability/mathematical concepts, (c) encouraging a focus on the entire research process, (d) facilitating student thinking about advanced statistical concepts, (e) allowing more time to explore, do, and talk about real research and messy data, and (f) acting as a firm-er foundation on which to build statistical intuition. Thus, we argue that simulation-based inference should be an entry point to an undergraduate statistics program for all students, and that simulation-based inference should be used throughout all under-graduate statistics courses. To achieve this goal and fully recognize the benefits of simulation-based inference on the undergraduate statistics program, we will need to break free of historical forces tying undergraduate statistics curricula to mathematics, consider radical and innovative new pedagogical approaches in our courses, fully implement assessment-driven content innovations, and embrace computation throughout the curriculum.

abstract = {The algebra-based introductory statistics course is the most popular undergraduate course in statistics. While there is a general consensus for the content of the curriculum, the recent Guidelines for Assessment and Instruction in Statistics Education (GAISE) have challenged the pedagogy of this course. Additionally, some arguments have been made that the curriculum should focus on a randomization approach to statistical inference instead of using asymptotic tests. We developed a preliminary version of a randomization based curriculum which we then implemented with 240 students in eight sections of introductory statistics in fall 2009. The Comprehensive Assessment of Outcomes in Statistics (CAOS) assessment test was administered to these students and showed that students learned significantly more about statistical inference using the new curriculum, with comparable learning on most other questions. The assessment results demonstrate that refining content, improving pedagogy and rethinking the consensus curriculum can significantly improve student learning. We will continue to refine both content and pedagogy resulting in improved student learning gains on CAOS items and other assessment measures. {\textcopyright} 2011 by Nathan Tintle, Jill VanderStoep, Vicki-Lynn Holmes, Brooke Quisenberry and Todd Swanson.},

abstract = {Development of efficient techniques for monitoring wildlife is a priority in the Arctic, where the impacts of climate change are acute and remoteness and logistical constraints hinder access. We evaluated high resolution satellite imagery as a tool to track the distribution and abundance of polar bears. We examined satellite images of a small island in Foxe Basin, Canada, occupied by a high density of bears during the summer ice-free season. Bears were distinguished from other light-colored spots by comparing images collected on different dates. A sample of ground-truthed points demonstrated that we accurately classified bears. Independent observers reviewed images and a population estimate was obtained using mark– recapture models. This estimate ( {\^{}} N: 94; 95{\%} Confidence Interval: 92–105) was remarkably similar to an abundance estimate derived from a line transect aerial survey conducted a few days earlier ( {\^{}} N: 102; 95{\%} CI: 69–152). Our findings suggest that satellite imagery is a promising tool for monitoring polar bears on land, with implications for use with other Arctic wildlife. Large scale applications may require development of automated detection processes to expedite review and analysis. Future research should assess the utility of multi-spectral imagery and examine sites with different environmental characteristics.},

abstract = {Ungulate reproductive success (calf production and survival) influences population performance. The moose (Alces alces) population in northeastern Minnesota, USA, has declined 65{\%} from 2006 to 2018 but has begun to stabilize. Because causes of this decline were largely unknown, we investigated production, survival, and cause-specific mortality of calves of the global positioning system (GPS)-collared females in this population. In 2013 and 2014, we GPS-collared 74 neonates and monitored them for survival. In 2015 and 2016, we monitored 50 and 35 calving females for signs of neonatal mortality using changes in adult female velocities and assessed seasonal calf survival by aerial surveys. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), survival to 9 months was 0.34 (95{\%} CI = 0.23???0.52) for collared calves, and in 2015 and 2016 (pooled) survival was 0.35 (95{\%} CI = 0.26???0.48) for uncollared calves. Mortality in all 4 years was high during the first 50 days of life. In 2013 and 2014 (pooled), calving sites were relatively safe for collared neonates; predator-kills occurred a median 17.0 days after departure and a median 1,142 m from calving sites. Predation was the leading cause of death of collared calves (84{\%} of mortalities), with wolves (Canis lupus) accounting for 77{\%} of these. Other forms of mortality for collared and uncollared calves included drowning, infection, vehicle collision, and natural abandonment. We documented higher wolf predation than other recent studies with similar predator communities. Identifying specific causes of calf mortality and understanding their relations to various landscape characteristics and other extrinsic factors should yield insight into mechanisms contributing to the declining moose population in northeastern Minnesota and serve as a basis for ecologically sound management responses.},

We encourage authors to be more explicit about the method they use (and number of bootstrap resamples used). We recommend the bias corrected and accelerated method as giving generally good performance; although researchers should be warned that coverage of bootstrap confidence intervals is characteristically less than the specified nominal level, and confidence interval evaluation by any method can be unreliable for small samples in some situations.},

I review some of the more persistent criticisms of P values and argue that most stem from misunderstandings or incorrect interpretations, rather than from intrinsic shortcomings of the P value. I show that P values are intimately linked to confidence intervals and to differences in Akaike's information criterion (delta(AIC)), two metrics that have been advocated as replacements for the P value. The choice of a threshold value of delta(AIC) that breaks ties among competing models is as arbitrary as the choice of the probability of a Type I error in hypothesis testing, and several other criticisms of the P value apply equally to delta(AIC). Since P values, confidence intervals, and delta(AIC) are based on the same statistical information, all have their places in modern statistical practice. The choice of which to use should be stylistic, dictated by details of the application rather than by dogmatic, a priori considerations.},

abstract = {The lack of an agreed inferential basis for statistics makes life "interesting" for academic statisticians, but at the price of negative implications for the status of statistics in industry, science, and government. The practice of our discipline will mature only when we can come to a basic agreement about how to apply statistics to real problems. Simple and more general illustrations are given of the negative consequences of the existing schism between frequentists and Bayesians. An assessment of strengths and weaknesses of the frequentist and Bayes systems of inference suggests that calibrated Bayes—a compromise based on the works of Box, Rubin, and others—captures the strengths of both approaches and provides a roadmap for future advances. The approach asserts that inferences under a particular model should be Bayesian, but model assessment can and should involve frequentist ideas. This article also discusses some implications of this proposed compromise for the teaching and practice of statistics. CR - Copyright {\&}{\#}169; 2006 American Statistical Association},

abstract = {North temperate species on the southern edge of their distribution are especially at risk to climate-induced changes. One such species is the moose (Alces alces), whose continental United States distribution is restricted to northern states or northern portions of the Rocky Mountain cordillera. We used a series of matrix models to evaluate the demographic implications of estimated survival and reproduction schedules for a moose population in northeastern Minnesota, USA, between 2002 and 2008. We used data from a telemetry study to calculate adult survival rates and estimated calf survival and fertility of adult females by using results of helicopter surveys. Estimated age-and year-specific survival rates showed a sinusoidal temporal pattern during our study and were lower for younger and old-aged animals. Estimates of annual adult survival (when assumed to be constant for ages {\textgreater}1.7 yr old) ranged from 0.74 to 0.85. Annual calf survival averaged 0.40, and the annual ratio of calves born to radiocollared females averaged 0.78. Point estimates for the finite rate of increase ($\lambda$) from yearly matrices ranged from 0.67 to 0.98 during our 6-year study, indicative of a long-term declining population. Assuming each matrix to be equally likely to occur in the future, we estimated a long-term stochastic growth rate of 0.85. Even if heat stress is not responsible for current levels of survival, continuation of this growth rate will ultimately result in a northward shift of the southern edge of moose distribution. Population growth rate, and its uncertainty, was most sensitive to changes in estimated adult survival rates. The relative importance of adult survival to population viability has important implications for harvest of large herbivores and the collection of information on wildlife fertility. {\textcopyright} 2010 The Wildlife Society.},

Here, we review alternatives to hypothesis testing including techniques for parameter estimation and model selection using likelihood and Bayesian techniques. These methods emphasize evaluation of weight of evidence for multiple hypotheses, multimodel inference, and use of prior information in analysis. We provide a tutorial for maximum likelihood estimation of model parameters and model selection using information theoretics, including a brief treatment of procedures for model comparison, model averaging, and use of data from multiple sources. We discuss the advantages of likelihood estimation, Bayesian analysis, and meta-analysis as ways to accumulate understanding across multiple studies. These statistical methods hold promise for new insight in ecology by encouraging thoughtful model building as part of inquiry, providing a unified framework for the empirical analysis of theoretical models, and by facilitating the formal accumulation of evidence bearing on fundamental questions.},

@article{Fieberg2009,
abstract = {Statistical methods that assume independence among observations result in optimistic estimates of uncertainty when applied to correlated data, which are ubiquitous in applied ecological research. Mixed effects models offer a potential solution and rely on the assumption that latent or unobserved characteristics of individuals (i.e. random effects) induce correlation among repeated measurements. However, careful consideration must be given to the interpretation of parameters when using a nonlinear link function (e.g. logit). Mixed model regression parameters reflect the change in the expected response within an individual associated with a change in that individual's covariates [i.e. a subject-specific (SS) interpretation], which may not address a relevant scientific question. In particular, a SS interpretation is not natural for covariates that do not vary within individuals (e.g. gender). 2. An alternative approach combines the solution to an unbiased estimating equation with robust measures of uncertainty to make inferences regarding predictor-outcome relationships. Regression parameters describe changes in the average response among groups of individuals differing in their covariates [i.e. a population-averaged (PA) interpretation]. 3. We compare these two approaches [mixed models and generalized estimating equations (GEE)] with illustrative examples from a 3-year study of mallard (Anas platyrhynchos) nest structures. We observe that PA and SS responses differ when modelling binary data, with PA parameters behaving like attenuated versions of SS parameters. Differences between SS and PA parameters increase with the size of among-subject heterogeneity captured by the random effects variance component. Lastly, we illustrate how PA inferences can be derived (post hoc) from fitted generalized and nonlinear-mixed models. 4. Synthesis and applications. Mixed effects models and GEE offer two viable approaches to modelling correlated data. The preferred method should depend primarily on the research question (i.e. desired parameter interpretation), although operating characteristics of the associated estimation procedures should also be considered. Many applied questions in ecology, wildlife management and conservation biology (including the current illustrative examples) focus on population performance measures (e.g. mean survival or nest success rates) as a function of general landscape features, for which the PA model interpretation, not the more commonly used SS model interpretation may be more natural. {\textcopyright} 2009 British Ecological Society.},

abstract = {Background:Wildlife populations are difficult to monitor directly because of costs and logistical challenges associated with collecting informative abundance data from live animals. By contrast, data on harvested individuals (e.g., age and sex) are often readily available. Increasingly, integrated population models are used for natural resource management because they synthesize various relevant data into a single analysis.{\&}Methodology/Principal Findings:We investigated the performance of integrated population models applied to black bears (Ursus americanus) in Minnesota, USA. Models were constructed using sex-specific age-at-harvest matrices (1980-2008), data on hunting effort and natural food supplies (which affects hunting success), and statewide mark-recapture estimates of abundance (1991, 1997, 2002). We compared this approach to Downing reconstruction, a commonly used population monitoring method that utilizes only age-at-harvest data. We first conducted a large-scale simulation study, in which our integrated models provided more accurate estimates of population trends than did Downing reconstruction. Estimates of trends were robust to various forms of model misspecification, including incorrectly specified cub and yearling survival parameters, age-related reporting biases in harvest data, and unmodeled temporal variability in survival and harvest rates. When applied to actual data on Minnesota black bears, the model predicted that harvest rates were negatively correlated with food availability and positively correlated with hunting effort, consistent with independent telemetry data. With no direct data on fertility, the model also correctly predicted 2-point cycles in cub production. Model-derived estimates of abundance for the most recent years provided a reasonable match to an empirical population estimate obtained after modeling efforts were completed.{\&}Conclusions/Significance: Integrated population modeling provided a reasonable framework for synthesizing age-at-harvest data, periodic large-scale abundance estimates, and measured covariates thought to affect harvest rates of black bears in Minnesota. Collection and analysis of these data appear to form the basis of a robust and viable population monitoring program.},

We consider a variety of regression modeling strategies for analyzing observational data associated with typical wildlife studies, including all subsets and stepwise regression, a single full model, and Akaike's Information Criterion (AIC)-based multimodel inference. Although there are advantages and disadvantages to each approach, we suggest that there is no unique best way to analyze data. Further, we argue that, although multimodel inference can be useful in natural resource management, the importance of considering causality and accurately estimating effect sizes is greater than simply considering a variety of models. Determining causation is far more valuable than simply indicating how the response variable and explanatory variables covaried within a data set, especially when the data set did not arise from a controlled experiment. Understanding the causal mechanism will provide much better predictions beyond the range of data observed.},

@article{FelsensteinJoseph1985,
abstract = {The recently-developed statistical method known as the "bootstrap" can be used to place confidence intervals on phylogenies. It involves resampling points from one's own data, with replacement, to create a series ofbootstrap samples ofthe same size as the original data. Each of these is analyzed, and the variation among the resulting estimates taken to indicate the size of the error involved in making estimates from the original data. In the case of phylogenies, it is argued that the proper method of resampling is to keep all of the original species while sampling characters with replacement, under the assumption that the characters have been independently drawn by the systematist and have evolved independently. Majority-rule consensus trees can be used to construct a phylogeny showing all of the inferred monophyletic groups that occurred in a majority of the bootstrap samples. If a group shows up 95{\%} of the time or more, the evidence for it is taken to be statistically significant. Existing computer programs can be used to analyze different bootstrap samples by using weights on the characters, the weight of a character being how many times it was drawn in bootstrap sampling. When all characters are perfectly compatible, as envisioned by Hennig, bootstrap sampling becomes unnecessary; the bootstrap method would show significant evidence for a group if it is defined by three or more characters.},

Preliminary assessment data have been largely positive. This article describes the analysis of the first year of data from a multi-institution assessment effort by instructors using such an approach in a college-level introductory statistics course, some for the first time. We examine several pre-/post-measures of student attitudes and conceptual understanding of several topics in the introductory course. We highlight some patterns in the data, focusing on student level and instructor level variables and the application of hierarchical modeling to these data. One observation of interest is that the newer instructors see very similar gains to more experienced instructors, but we also look to how the data collection and analysis can be improved for future years, especially the need for more data on “nonusers.”},

day="14",
abstract="In the analysis of clustered or hierarchical data, a variety of statistical techniques can be applied. Most of these techniques have assumptions that are crucial to the validity of their outcome. Mixed models rely on the correct specification of the random effects structure. Generalized estimating equations are most efficient when the working correlation form is chosen correctly and are not feasible when the within-subject variable is non-factorial. Assumptions and limitations of another common approach, ANOVA for repeated measurements, are even more worrisome: listwise deletion when data are missing, the sphericity assumption, inability to model an unevenly spaced time variable and time-varying covariates, and the limitation to normally distributed dependent variables. This paper introduces ClusterBootstrap, an R package for the analysis of hierarchical data using generalized linear models with the cluster bootstrap (GLMCB). Being a bootstrap method, the technique is relatively assumption-free, and it has already been shown to be comparable, if not superior, to GEE in its performance. The paper has three goals. First, GLMCB will be introduced. Second, there will be an empirical example, using the ClusterBootstrap package for a Gaussian and a dichotomous dependent variable. Third, GLMCB will be compared to mixed models in a Monte Carlo experiment. Although GLMCB can be applied to a multitude of hierarchical data forms, this paper discusses it in the context of the analysis of repeated measurements or longitudinal data. It will become clear that the GLMCB is a promising alternative to mixed models and the ClusterBootstrap package an easy-to-use R implementation of the technique.",
